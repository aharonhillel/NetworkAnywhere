# Social Chats

As COVID-19 forces more and more individuals to work from home, there has an been an increase in social isolatin. I haev build this application to try to counteract this impact. [Platform Name] was built to seamlessly pair you with one or more of your colleagues to casually chat, catch up, and network! Enter your name, email and how many minutes you are free and if anyone else is free during the same time, you will both receive an email notifying you of the mutual availability. 
 

## Getting Started

NodeJS with Postgres Database, deployed on Heroku

### Future Features:

* REDIS Caching as well as load balancer for scalability
* Ability to select groups to filter pairings (e.g. only be paired with users in RCP)
* User accounts to update availability
* Team's integrated Chatbot
* Sync with Outlook calendar for automatic integration
